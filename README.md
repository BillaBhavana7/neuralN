FILES:-

ICP1-PB1 
Delete at least 2 characters, reverse the resultant string
ICP1-PB2 
Replace each occurrence of ‘python’ with ‘pythons’
ICP1-PB3  
Letter grade based on an input class score, using if statement conditions

ICP2-PB1 
Write a program that takes two strings from the user: first_name, last_name. Pass these variables to
fullname function that should return the (full name).
o Write function named “string_alternative” that returns every other char in the full_name string.
ICP1-PB2 
Write a python program to find the wordcount in a file (input.txt) for each line and then print the output.
o Finally store the output in output.txt file.
ICP1-PB3 
Write a program, which reads heights (inches.) of customers into a list and convert these
heights to centimeters in a separate list using:
1) Nested Interactive loop.
2) List comprehensions

ICP3-PB1
 Create a class Employee and then do the following
• Create a data member to count the number of Employees
• Create a constructor to initialize name, family, salary, department
• Create a function to average salary
• Create a Fulltime Employee class and it should inherit the properties of Employee 
class
• Create the instances of Fulltime Employee class and Employee class and call their 
member functions.
ICP3-PB2
. Numpy
Using NumPy create random vector of size 20 having only float in the 
range 1-20.
Then reshape the array to 4 by 5
Then replace the max in each row by 0 (axis=1)
(you can NOT implement it via for loop)

ICP4_PB1
1. Data Manipulation
a. Read the provided CSV file ‘data.csv’.
b. https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1h8C3mLsso-R-sIOLsvoYwPLzy2fJ4IOF?usp=sharing
c. Show the basic statistical description about the data.
d. Check if the data has null values.
i. Replace the null values with the mean
e. Select at least two columns and aggregate the data using: min, max, count, mean.
f. Filter the dataframe to select the rows with calories values between 500 and 1000.
g. Filter the dataframe to select the rows with calories values > 500 and pulse < 100.
h. Create a new “df_modified” dataframe that contains all the columns from df except for
“Maxpulse”.
i. Delete the “Maxpulse” column from the main df dataframe
j. Convert the datatype of Calories column to int datatype.
k. Using pandas create a scatter plot for the two columns (Duration and Calories).
ICP4-PB2
2. Linear Regression
a) Import the given “Salary_Data.csv”
b) Split the data in train_test partitions, such that 1/3 of the data is reserved as test subset.
c) Train and predict the model.
d) Calculate the mean_squared error
e) Visualize both train and test data using scatter plot.
